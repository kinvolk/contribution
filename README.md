# Kinvolk Contribution Guidelines

This repository will contain information on how to contribute to Kinvolk's

The idea is that we have a set of guidelines around the development of
projects, that is reasonable and easy to understand, so we promote
consistency and quality in Kinvolk's projects as a common effort.
