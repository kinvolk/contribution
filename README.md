This repository will contain information on how to contribute to Kinvolk's
projects.

The idea is that we have a set of guidelines around the development of
projects, that is reasonable and easy to understand, so we promote
consistency and quality in Kinvolk's projects as a common effort.

In the interest of promoting a fair, diverse, and open community, Kinvolk
uses its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for all its projects.
